#Advanced Collection View

Originally, this was a copy of Apple's latest AdvancedCollectionView sample code, with lightweight generics and other Xcode 7 / iOS 9 features removed, and packaged in a nice cocoa pod for easy use. But since Xcode 7 is now out, the Xcode 7 and iOS 9 specific features have been re-introduced. So now the main reason for this library's existence is to be easily included in projects using Cocoapods, but has also had some bugs fixed.
